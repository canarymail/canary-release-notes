New: 🛠️ Customizable Dashboard - Organize your dashboard like a boss, with the freedom to rearrange sections and widgets to match your style! 😉
New: 📞 Tag a Contact - Speed up your emailing game by mentioning contacts using "@" - they'll be added directly to the 'To' field, no more searching like a detective on caffeine! 🕵️‍♀️
New: 🖨️ Print Mail, But Better - Revamped print format with cc and bcc fields included, because email drama deserves a little paper drama too! 📠🎭
