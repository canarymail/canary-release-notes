A few more bugs squashed, a few more improvements made â€” all to keep your inbox smooth and stress-free.

New: âœ… Mark as Read under Unread Filter â€“ You can now mark emails as read even when viewing the Unread filter.

Fixed: ðŸ“Œ Missing Pinned Emails â€“ Older emails pinned via Search results now show up as expected.
Fixed: ðŸ§µ Pinned + Threading Issues â€“ Switching the Organize by Thread setting no longer affects the visibility of pinned emails.
