We’ve been hard at work improving your Canary Mail experience on Android — fixing bugs and polishing the interface to keep things smooth and reliable.

New: ✅ Multi-Select in Search – You can now select multiple emails directly from search results.

Fixed: 👀 Preview Leak – Fixed a bug where .txt attachments in drafts leaked their content into the email preview.
Fixed: 📄 Blank 'Show Original' – Some emails now correctly display when tapping on ‘Show Original’.
Fixed: 🔍 Swipe Actions in Search – You can now use swipe actions like delete or archive within search results.
Fixed: 📁 Folder Sorting – Sub-folders now appear in ascending alphabetical order when created.

We’re always refining the Canary experience—thanks for being part of the journey! 🚀
