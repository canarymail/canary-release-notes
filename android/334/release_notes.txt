We're excited to bring you important fixes to enhance your email experience on Android! 🎉

Fixed: ✍️ Drafts Saving: Resolved an issue where drafts couldn't be saved, ensuring your work is always preserved seamlessly.
Fixed: 📥 Reply-to Behavior: Addressed a bug where replying to an email added the sender's address to the 'To' field instead of the original recipient. This ensures consistent and accurate email replies.

We hope these updates make your email management smoother. Stay tuned for more improvements! 🚀
