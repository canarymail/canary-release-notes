We're excited to roll out new updates and fixes to make your email experience smoother and more intuitive!

New: 📅 Calendar Integration: Access and manage your calendar directly within the app! Currently supported for Gmail accounts, with support for additional providers coming soon.
Fixed: 🔐 PGP Passphrase: Password now works for the entire mailbox rather than only the specific email thread.

We hope you enjoy these improvements. Stay tuned for more updates! 🎉
