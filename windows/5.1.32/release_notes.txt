Weâ€™ve continued refining the Canary Mail experience to improve stability, usability, and performance on Windows.

New: ðŸ“¨ Read Receipt Indicator â€“ Now shows within the email thread as well when reading messages.
New: âœ… Mark as Read under Unread Filter â€“ You can now mark emails as read even when viewing the Unread filter.

Fixed: ðŸ”§ ProtonMail Bridge â€“ You can now archive or delete emails without issues.

Thanks for being with us on the journey. ðŸš€
