Version 5.0.38
We're excited to bring you another set of updates aimed at improving your Canary Mail experience on Windows! 

Fixed: 🛠️ Crash Issues: Addressed stability issues for a smoother, more reliable performance.

New: 📧 Recipient Tagging in Compose: Use @ in the compose text to tag a recipient and automatically add them to the recipient field.
New: 🌍 Enhanced Spell Check Support: Canary Mail now supports system languages other than English for spell check, so you can catch those typos in more languages while you type!

We hope these updates improve your overall experience and make email management even smoother. Stay tuned for more updates! 🎉
