Fixed: 📌 Starred Folder Visibility – Starred emails from subfolders in Outlook/Office365/iCloud now appear correctly.
Fixed: 🖼️ Inbox Zero Image – Background image now shows up properly when inbox is cleared.
Fixed: 🖇️ Inline Image Paste – Drag-and-drop no longer causes inline images to be pasted twice.
Fixed: 👤 Contact Pop-Up – ‘Show Contact’ now opens without showing a blank spinner.
Fixed: 👁️ AI Assistant Flash – Selecting “See Emails” no longer causes flickering or message disappearance.

Thanks for using Canary on Mac — more enhancements are coming your way! 🚀
