We’re excited to bring you a fresh round of fixes and enhancements to make your Canary experience smoother and more intuitive!

Fixed: Rules for Capitalized Addresses: Rules now function as expected, even if the sender’s address is written in capital letters.
Fixed: Search Actions: You can now switch between “Search this thread” and “Search Everywhere” seamlessly in the Copilot Chat search field.

New: Label Management Enhancements: You can now directly create labels from the email list, with updated icons and improved spacing for a cleaner view.
New: Paste Without Formatting: In addition to "Paste and Match Style", you can now also paste text without formatting!

We hope these updates make your Canary experience even better. Stay tuned for more!
