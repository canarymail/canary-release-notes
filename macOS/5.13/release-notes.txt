This update brings a handful of fixes to keep things running smoothly on macOS.

Fixed: 🖨️ Print Orientation – Printing now correctly supports switching between Portrait and Landscape.
Fixed: 🔠 Font Size Scaling – Increasing font size in Preferences and the Sidebar no longer cuts off text for O365 and Exchange accounts.
Fixed: 🗯️ Quoted Replies – Replies from Sent/Inbox now correctly include previously sent messages in the quoted text.

More refinements are on the way — thanks for sticking with us and sharing feedback that helps shape every update.
