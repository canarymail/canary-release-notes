We’re excited to roll out key fixes to make your email experience on macOS smoother and more efficient!

Fixed: 🔤 Sidebar Font Size – Font size changes in Settings now apply correctly to All Accounts, Favorites, and Account Names in the left sidebar.
Fixed: 🌐 Inbox Categories – Resolved an issue where non-English languages caused some tab text to be cut off in Inbox Categories.
Fixed: 📋 Image Paste in Compose – Copy and pasting of images into the Compose window now work seamlessly.
Fixed: 🛑 Email Address Case Sensitivity – You’ll no longer see a warning when the recipient's email address only differs in capitalization.

We’re always refining the Canary experience—thanks for being part of the journey! 🚀
