ðŸš€ Canary Mail Update ðŸš€
Weâ€™re excited to roll out our latest update packed with fixes and improvements!

Fixed: Full Screen Calendar Mode: Fixed an issue where switching between Full Screen Calendar and email list caused the email list button to disappear. Now, you can easily toggle back and forth without a hitch!
Fixed: Font Size Adjustment: Increasing font size in settings now affects the entire email, not just the 'To,' 'From,' and subject lines. Enjoy a more comfortable reading experience!

Weâ€™re committed to improving your workflowâ€”stay tuned for more updates!
