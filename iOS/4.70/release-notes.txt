We’re excited to roll out our latest update packed with fixes and improvements!

Fixed: All Accounts in Sidebar: Tapping "All Accounts" now reliably opens the All Inbox menu. Tap anywhere on the line for quick access!
Fixed: Copilot Schedule: Times now display correctly and update smoothly in Copilot Schedule settings.
Fixed: File Sharing: Fixed an issue in iOS 18 where file sharing from ‘Files’ would show a “Sharing” prompt without completing the action.
Fixed: Label Selection: Tapping on labels now works as expected for quick organization.

New: Paste Without Formatting: In addition to existing paste options, you can now also paste text without formatting.
New: @Mentions in Compose: You can now tag recipients directly in the compose text using "@" and they will get added to the recipient field!

We hope these updates make your Canary experience smoother. Stay tuned—more great things are on the way!
