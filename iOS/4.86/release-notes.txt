Fixed: 👻 Phantom Mail Cells – Blank rows no longer appear for new emails.
Fixed: ⏰ Customize Time UI Glitch – Customize Time options are now fully visible and selectable on both iPhone and iPad.
Fixed: 🕌 RTL Text Alignment – Composing emails in RTL languages now starts from the correct right-to-left alignment.
