We’ve been fine-tuning the Canary Mail experience to make everyday workflows smoother.

New: ✔️ You can now mark emails as read automatically when the 'read filter' is enabled.

Fixed: 🖇️ Attachments Display – Files with the same name and format now appear distinctly, even when multiple attachments are received.
Fixed: 🧩 Addressed missing translations in some parts of the app.

Your feedback keeps us moving — stay tuned for more updates. 🔧
